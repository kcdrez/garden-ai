# Garden AI — Agent Context File

This file provides project-wide context. Stack, conventions, and tooling details live in the directory-level files:
- Frontend: `/frontend/CLAUDE.md`
- Backend: `/backend/CLAUDE.md`

---

# 📓 Dev Log

The dev log lives at `/docs/devlog.md`. It is the canonical record of what was built and what's next.

## Intention

A lightweight session journal — one entry per work session, focused on what shipped. Not a design doc or a bug tracker; just enough signal for an AI agent (or the developer) to orient quickly at the start of the next session.

## Format

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — ~N hours

**Completed:**
- Short bullet describing what shipped

**Next up:** One-line summary of what to tackle next
```

## Consumption (start of session)

At the start of every session, read the most recent devlog entry before doing anything else. Use it to:
- Understand what was just finished so you don't re-explain or redo it
- Pick up the **Next up** item as the default starting point if the user hasn't given a specific direction
- Cross-reference against the ✅ Completed list below if something seems missing

## Adding a new entry (end of session)

At the end of a session — or when the user asks — append a new dated entry to `/docs/devlog.md`. Rules:
- One entry per session, appended at the top (newest first)
- **Completed** bullets are high-level; skip internal refactors and tooling noise unless they unblock something
- **Next up** is a single line, not a list — the most important thing to tackle next
- After appending, cross-check the ✅ Completed list in this file and update it if anything is missing or stale

# 🧠 Project Overview

Garden AI is a full-stack web application for managing and visualizing home garden layouts and plant data.

The long-term goal is to evolve into a system that can:

- manage garden layouts
- track plant growth and placement
- provide gardening recommendations (potential AI features later)

## Purpose & Context

This is primarily a **portfolio project** built to deepen experience across the full stack and support a job search. It may grow into something more, but learning and demonstrable depth are the primary goals.

**The developer brings:**
- 10+ years of frontend experience (primarily Vue)
- ~1.5 years of Django backend experience
- Little to no DevOps experience

**Learning goals for this project:**
- React (TypeScript) — applying existing frontend expertise in a new ecosystem
- Full-stack development — owning the entire feature lifecycle end-to-end
- DevOps — hands-on experience with deployment, CI/CD, and cloud infrastructure (Vercel + AWS)

**Implications for AI agents:**
- React patterns and idioms are a learning surface — prefer explaining non-obvious choices rather than just implementing them
- Django patterns may be familiar but assume React/TypeScript idioms are being actively learned
- DevOps tooling should be introduced gradually with clear rationale; don't assume prior AWS/CI knowledge

# 📁 Repository Structure

/frontend  → React application (see /frontend/CLAUDE.md)
/backend   → Django REST API (see /backend/CLAUDE.md)
/docs      → Optional documentation
/CLAUDE.md → This file

---

# 🔐 Authentication

- Backend uses SimpleJWT for token-based auth
- Frontend stores tokens in localStorage and attaches via Axios interceptor
- All `/api/*` routes except auth endpoints require authentication
- Route protection is enforced via loader functions in the frontend router

# 🌱 Core Domain Model

Fields marked *(planned)* exist in the schema design but are not yet built.

### User *(extended)*
Django's default User plus:
- timezone *(planned)*
- locale *(planned)*

### Garden
- id: UUID or AutoField
- name: string (required)
- description: text (optional)
- location: string *(planned)*
- hardiness_zone: string *(planned)*
- created_at: datetime (auto)
- updated_at: datetime (auto)
- owner: ForeignKey(User)

### GardenBed
- id: UUID
- garden: ForeignKey(Garden)
- name: string (required)
- length: positive integer (required)
- width: positive integer (required)
- depth: positive integer (optional — wall height for raised beds)
- unit: enum — `in`, `ft`, `cm`, `m` (default: ft)
- facing: enum — `N`, `NE`, `E`, `SE`, `S`, `SW`, `W`, `NW` (optional)
- avg_sunlight_hours: positive integer 0–24 (optional)
- soil_type: string (optional — freeform, e.g. "loamy clay with amendments")
- notes: text (optional)
- created_at: datetime (auto)
- updated_at: datetime (auto)

### Plant
- id: UUID
- common_name: string
- scientific_name: string
- category: enum — `vegetable`, `herb`, `fruit`, `flower`, `other`
- description: text
- Global seeded catalog (41 plants); read-only via API (`GET /api/plants/`)

### UserPlant — plant placement in a bed
- id: UUID
- bed: ForeignKey(GardenBed)
- plant: ForeignKey(Plant)
- variety: string (optional — e.g. "Cherry Tomato")
- planted_date: date (optional)
- status: enum — `planned`, `planted`, `growing`, `harvested`, `removed`
- notes: text (optional)
- created_at / updated_at: datetime (auto)

### Season *(planned)*
Groups planting activity by growing year/season. Enables crop rotation tracking and year-over-year comparisons. Without this, all UserPlants are a flat list scoped only by date, making rotation logic very difficult. Likely owned by a Garden.

### PlantVariety *(planned — design decision pending)*
Distinguishes cultivars ("Cherokee Purple", "Roma") from species ("Tomato"). Could be a field on `UserPlant` (simpler) or a separate model (required if AI or catalog features need variety-specific advice). Decide before building the plant catalog.

### Observation *(planned)*
A unified event log attached to a `UserPlant` or `GardenBed`. Covers pest sightings, watering notes, fertilizing events, and general journal entries — all share the same structure (date, note, type). Prevents proliferating separate models for each tracking feature.

### HarvestLog *(planned)*
Records individual harvest events with a quantity/weight measurement. Distinct from `Observation` because it's a measurement, not a note. Could fold into `Observation` with a type field, or stand alone — decide when building harvest tracking.

### Task *(planned)*
Reminders and to-dos optionally linked to a Garden, GardenBed, or UserPlant. Has a due date and a completed flag. The notification/scheduling side is handled by Celery (already planned).

### Photo *(planned)*
Generic image attachment linkable to multiple entity types (Garden, GardenBed, UserPlant). Implementation options: Django content type framework (`GenericForeignKey`) or explicit nullable FKs per entity — decide when building image uploads.

### AIConversation *(planned)*
- user: ForeignKey(User)
- prompt: text
- response: text

---

### Plant catalog ownership *(design decision)*
The `Plant` catalog is currently implied to be a global shared catalog (all users reference the same "Tomato" entry). This is the right default for AI features and companion planting data, but requires a curation/seeding strategy. A hybrid (global catalog + user-created custom varieties) is common but more complex — defer unless needed.

---

Ownership is enforced at the queryset level — users only see and modify their own gardens.

### Garden API contract

- `GET    /api/gardens/`                    → 200 `[{ id, name, description, created_at, updated_at, owner }]`
- `POST   /api/gardens/`                    → 201 `{ id, name, description, created_at, updated_at, owner }`
- `GET    /api/gardens/:id/`               → 200 `{ id, ... }`
- `PATCH  /api/gardens/:id/`               → 200 `{ id, ... }`
- `DELETE /api/gardens/:id/`               → 204

### GardenBed API contract

Nested under a garden — ownership enforced via the parent garden's owner check.

- `GET    /api/gardens/:id/beds/`          → 200 `[{ id, garden, name, length, width, depth, unit, facing, avg_sunlight_hours, soil_type, notes, created_at, updated_at }]`
- `POST   /api/gardens/:id/beds/`          → 201 `{ id, ... }`
- `GET    /api/gardens/:id/beds/:bedId/`   → 200 `{ id, ... }`
- `PATCH  /api/gardens/:id/beds/:bedId/`   → 200 `{ id, ... }`
- `DELETE /api/gardens/:id/beds/:bedId/`   → 204

---

# 🌐 API Conventions

- Base URL: `/api/`
- Auth endpoints: `/api/auth/*`
- Responses are JSON
- Timestamps in ISO 8601 format
- All JSON field names are camelCase (e.g. `avgSunlightHours`, `createdAt`) — converted automatically by `djangorestframework-camel-case`. Django serializers and models remain snake_case; the conversion happens at the HTTP boundary.
- JWT access tokens expire in 5 minutes (SimpleJWT default). The frontend client silently refreshes using the stored refresh token on 401 and retries the original request.

---

# 🚧 Current Focus

> "Vertical Slice Development" — build full features end-to-end, avoid infrastructure work unless blocking, prioritize visible functionality over abstraction.

---

# 🏁 MVP Definition

The MVP is considered complete when:
- Users can create accounts and log in
- Users can manage gardens, beds, and plants
- AI recommendations are functional
- App is deployed publicly with HTTPS
- CI/CD pipeline is functional
- Dockerized local development works

---

# 🚫 Non-Goals

These are explicitly out of scope, at least initially:
- Kubernetes
- Microservices architecture
- Multi-tenant / enterprise support
- Complex AI agents or autonomous systems
- Real-time multiplayer collaboration
- Marketplace or ecommerce functionality

---

# ❌ Do NOT Do (for AI agents)

- Do not introduce new frameworks without explicit instruction
- Do not refactor architecture prematurely
- Do not add complex abstractions (CQRS, service layers, etc.)
- Do not add authentication complexity unless required
- Do not optimize prematurely

---

# ✅ Preferred AI Behavior

- Prefer small, incremental changes
- Preserve existing patterns unless broken
- Prioritize working end-to-end features
- Ask before introducing new dependencies
- Assume simplicity over scalability unless stated otherwise

---

# 🌿 Features

## ✅ Completed

- User authentication (login/logout, JWT tokens, protected routes)
- User registration (`POST /api/auth/register/` — creates user and returns JWT tokens; frontend at `/register` with link from login page)
- Dark mode toggle (persisted to localStorage, synced with OS preference)
- Create, delete, and view multiple gardens
- Edit existing gardens (name and description, via inline dialog)
- Garden list as responsive card grid
- Field-level server error mapping on forms
- Garden detail page (`/gardens/:id`) — dedicated page per garden
- Garden bed CRUD — create, edit, delete beds nested under a garden; beds display name, dimensions, facing, sunlight, soil type, and notes on the card
- Abstract `BaseModel` in `core/` app — all models inherit `id` (UUID), `created_at`, `updated_at`
- Plant catalog (`GET /api/plants/`) — global seeded catalog of 41 common plants across vegetable, herb, fruit, flower, and other categories; read-only via API
- UserPlant CRUD — add, edit, delete plants within a garden bed (`/api/gardens/:id/beds/:bedId/plants/`); supports variety, planted date, status, and notes
- Garden bed detail page (`/gardens/:id/beds/:bedId`) — dedicated bookmarkable page per bed; shows full metadata (facing, sunlight, soil type, notes) and plant list with full CRUD; bed metadata editable via modal
- Plant catalog picker UI — replaces native select in the add/edit plant flow; searchable by name, filterable by category pills; selected plant shown as a persistent chip so context is clear when switching filters
- Bed cards on the garden detail page simplified to summary view — clicking the card navigates to the bed detail page; edit/delete still accessible from the card's dropdown
- camelCase API responses — `djangorestframework-camel-case` converts snake_case at the HTTP boundary; frontend types and Zod schemas updated to match
- JWT silent refresh — on 401, frontend retries the original request with a fresh token; redirects to login if refresh fails
- Feature-based folder structure for `/components` and `/pages` — organized by domain (gardens, plants, shared, etc.)
- PostgreSQL (local) — replaced SQLite with PostgreSQL; environment variables managed via `python-decouple`
- Docker + Docker Compose — full local dev stack (frontend, backend, PostgreSQL) runs with `docker compose up -d`; hot reload via volume mounts; DB healthcheck ensures startup order
- Vercel deployment — frontend live at `https://garden-ai-gamma.vercel.app`; auto-deploys on push to `main`; `VITE_API_URL` env var for backend URL; `vercel.json` rewrite rule for React Router SPA routing
- Railway deployment — Django backend live at `https://garden-ai-production-6a57.up.railway.app`; managed PostgreSQL on Railway; gunicorn + whitenoise for production serving; `dj-database-url` parses `DATABASE_URL`

## 📋 Planned

### Authentication & Accounts
- User profile (timezone, locale settings, first/last name)
- Social login (Google, Facebook, etc.) via `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` — add alongside existing username/password auth, not as a replacement

### Garden Organization (core)
- Visual garden layout management
- Customizable garden dimensions and grids
- Drag-and-drop garden design interface
- Garden templates and presets

### Plants
- Move a plant from one bed to another (PATCH `bed` field on UserPlant — enforce target bed ownership)
- View all beds across all gardens — flat list or grouped by garden; useful for planning and cross-garden comparisons (build alongside or after move-plant so the view is actionable)
- View all plants (UserPlants) across all gardens/beds — useful for seeing everything currently growing, especially during planning phases; pairs naturally with move-plant
- Add plants to garden layouts
- Plant spacing guidance
- Plant growth and lifecycle tracking
- Seed starting and transplant planning
- Seasonal planting schedules

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) for automated deploy on merge
